  title: 2025 Year-End Investor Update
  summary: Orthogonal Thinker enters 2026 as a unified, audited, and NASDAQ-bound
    holding company—integrating EI Ventures, Pluto 11.11, and its global
    ecosystem into one transparent, frequency-aligned structure bridging
    consciousness, capital, and exponential innovation.
  body: >-
    <p>Dear Investors and Friends,</p>

    <p>
      As 2025 comes to a close, we extend our deepest gratitude for your trust,
      patience, and partnership.
    </p>

    <p>
      This was a transformative year for Orthogonal Thinker, EI Ventures, Reinmkr,
      Pluto 11.11, LIF3, Surya, and Psilly — a year of alignment, integration, and
      clarity as we move from vision to structure and from structure to revelation.
    </p>


    <h2>From Reinmkr to Orthogonal — A 20-Year Journey</h2>

    <p>
      In 2009, David Nikzad and Jason Hobson founded Reinmkr, a private fund built
      on a simple yet radical belief: that capital follows frequency, and that
      alignment between people, purpose, and prosperity creates enduring value.
    </p>

    <p>
      That belief became Orthogonal Thinker Inc. — a global holding company that
      integrates ventures in digital assets, AI, longevity, plant medicine, energy,
      and space.
    </p>

    <p>
      Reinmkr remains the foundation; Orthogonal is its refined expression — a
      living architecture where consciousness and commerce intersect at right
      angles.
    </p>


    <h2>2025 — Execution, Alignment &amp; Preparation</h2>

    <p>
      This year was about building infrastructure that endures and scales with
      integrity.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Cloud3 Audit Completed. Cloud3 Ventures (CSE: CLDV) finalized its
        independent audit, setting the transparency standard for our ecosystem.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ecosystem Integration. We prepared the consolidation of EI Ventures and
        Pluto 11.11 into Orthogonal Thinker Inc., uniting all investors under one
        structure.
      </li>
      <li>
        Orthogonal Audit Roadmap. A comprehensive audit of Orthogonal and its
        subsidiaries will commence in 2026 as part of the consolidation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Global Shareholder Base. Over 11,000 shareholders worldwide; systems
        expanded for governance and communication.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer Agent. Endeavor Trust remains our partner as we modernize investor
        infrastructure for the digital era.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Orthogonal enters 2026 aligned and ready for the next stage of consolidation.
    </p>


    <h2>Strategic Highlights of 2025</h2>

    <h3>Firefly Aerospace — Patience Realized</h3>

    <p>
      Our Series A participation in Firefly Aerospace four years ago came full
      circle with its public listing — a validation of Orthogonal’s long-horizon
      approach to frontier technology.
    </p>

    <h3>BNC — Blockchain Treasury &amp; Financial Innovation</h3>

    <p>
      Our investment in BNC, a BNB-aligned treasury platform, anchored a $500
      million digital-asset transaction and showcased our capacity to engineer
      compliant, institutional-grade blockchain finance.
    </p>

    <h3>STRIVE (ASST) — Bitcoin as the Global Reserve Asset</h3>

    <p>
      Orthogonal took a significant position in STRIVE (ASST), a publicly traded
      vehicle bridging traditional finance and digital assets. We view Bitcoin as
      the new global reserve currency — an energy-anchored, mathematically
      trustworthy foundation for a rebalanced financial system. Through STRIVE, we
      are positioned to help build that system and align our treasury strategy with
      the future of sound money.
    </p>

    <h3>Odyssey Elixir — Functional Wellness Scales</h3>

    <p>
      Portfolio company Odyssey Elixir entered Costco’s national distribution
      network, proving that frequency-based wellness and functional nutrition can
      reach mass adoption.
    </p>

    <h3>Psilly &amp; EI Ventures — Science Meets Spirit</h3>

    <p>
      Psilly, the origin of EI Ventures, continues advancing plant-medicine and
      emotional-wellness technologies that merge ancient therapies and modern
      science.
    </p>

    <h3>Capital Markets Leadership — World Mobile &amp; Blockstreet</h3>

    <p>
      David Nikzad serves as Head of Capital Markets for World Mobile Group and
      Blockstreet.
    </p>

    <p>
      At World Mobile, he helps scale a decentralized telecom network connecting the
      unconnected; at Blockstreet, a launchpad platform, he leverages his experience
      from WeFunder and Republic to merge crowdfunding innovation with institutional
      discipline.
    </p>

    <h3>Reinmkr — The Philosophical Core</h3>

    <p>
      Reinmkr remains our energetic center — the belief that capital is an extension
      of consciousness and that investing in frequency is investing in the future.
    </p>


    <h2>Governance &amp; Structural Milestones</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Cloud3 Ventures Audit. Completed in 2025, establishing transparent reporting
        and setting the standard for our ecosystem.
      </li>
      <li>
        Orthogonal Ecosystem Audit. Full audit to begin in 2026 as part of the
        consolidation process.
      </li>
      <li>
        Digital Asset Treasury (DAT 3.0). Our treasury architecture now unifies
        on-chain transparency with traditional accounting — a blueprint for the
        public-market era of Conscious Capital.
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Strategic Integration and Expansion</h2>

    <h3>EI Ventures &amp; Pluto Integration — January 2026</h3>

    <p>
      We are finalizing the consolidation of EI Ventures and Pluto 11.11 into
      Orthogonal Thinker Inc. This transaction will be completed in January 2026,
      uniting all shareholders, brands, and intellectual property under one cap
      table and one vision.
    </p>

    <h3>Capital Infrastructure Group (CIG)</h3>

    <p>
      The Capital Infrastructure Group designs and originates specialized
      transactions in AI, energy, and digital assets — connecting institutional
      capital with frontier innovation through compliant, mission-driven
      architecture.
    </p>

    <h3>Insomnia Labs Partnership — DAT 3.0 on NASDAQ</h3>

    <p>
      Our four-year partnership with Insomnia Labs is the defining collaboration for
      our next chapter. Together we are creating the DAT 3.0 NASDAQ framework, which
      will serve as the foundation for a unified, publicly traded Orthogonal Thinker
      Inc. vehicle.
    </p>

    <p>
      This structure merges Insomnia’s technical and creative expertise with our
      capital architecture to build a transparent, programmable public company that
      embodies Conscious Capital.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is the core of our 2026 vision: a single NASDAQ-listed structure that
      brings the entire Orthogonal ecosystem together under one standard of
      alignment and frequency.
    </p>


    <h2>Operational Initiatives — Cap Table &amp; Investor Portal</h2>

    <p>
      We know many investors are curious about how we’ll manage our transfer agent
      and shareholder records. We continue working closely with Endeavor Trust to
      determine the most effective way to digitize our entire cap table.
    </p>

    <p>
      It’s not a simple process — it requires precision, compliance, and technical
      innovation. Over the next two months, we’ll be doubling down on our Investor
      Portal, which will become the primary interface for all shareholders in the
      Orthogonal ecosystem.
    </p>

    <p>
      After pausing development to complete the Cloud3 audit, we have resumed full
      focus on this project. Cap-table digitization and portal completion are key
      pillars of the 2026 roadmap, and we deeply appreciate everyone’s patience as
      we deliver this modernization.
    </p>


    <h2>Portfolio Impact</h2>

    <p>
      Our companies delivered strong performance and real-world validation of our
      mission:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Firefly Aerospace — successful IPO and liquidity event.</li>
      <li>BNC — major digital-asset treasury transaction.</li>
      <li>STRIVE (ASST) — strategic Bitcoin exposure and macro alignment.</li>
      <li>Odyssey Elixir — national retail expansion.</li>
      <li>Meadow — continued leadership in cannabis compliance software.</li>
      <li>
        Cloud3 &amp; LIF3 — advances in validator-node and AI-integrated DeFi
        infrastructure.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Beyond these milestones, the Orthogonal ecosystem encompasses a broad network
      of investments and collaborations across wellness, fintech, blockchain, and
      space — from early-stage equity in EquipmentShare, WeFunder, Republic, and
      Betterment, to strategic positions in Animoca Brands, Unstoppable Domains,
      Supra Oracles, Polygon, Dynasty Studios, Compass Mining, Near Protocol,
      Insomnia Labs, and Axiom Space.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our reach extends across AI, DeFi, wellness technology (NovoBeing), plant
      science, and frontier infrastructure.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each company reinforces the next, forming a living ecosystem of innovation
      guided by Orthogonal’s principles of consciousness, alignment, and exponential
      value creation.
    </p>


    <h2>Looking Ahead to 2026 — Unification Through Orthogonal</h2>

    <p>
      2026 marks Orthogonal Thinker’s 10-Year Anniversary and the culmination of a
      two-decade vision.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is the year we bring everything to the top of the funnel — Orthogonal
      Thinker Inc. All ventures, brands, and partnerships will unite in a NASDAQ
      vehicle built on the DAT 3.0 standard in collaboration with Insomnia Labs.
    </p>

    <p>Our focus for the year ahead:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Finalize the EI Ventures and Pluto integration in January 2026.</li>
      <li>
        Launch the Insomnia Labs DAT 3.0 NASDAQ framework to unify the ecosystem.
      </li>
      <li>
        Integrate our STRIVE (ASST) Bitcoin initiative into treasury strategy.
      </li>
      <li>Complete the Investor Portal and cap-table digitization program.</li>
      <li>
        Begin construction of the Orthogonal Innovation Hub in Hawai‘i, a
        regenerative campus where AI, wellness, and energy systems merge.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      2026 is the year of unification and ascension — when Orthogonal Thinker Inc.
      becomes a living public structure embodying the alignment of frequency,
      finance, and human potential.
    </p>


    <h2>Perspective &amp; Gratitude</h2>

    <p>
      From Reinmkr (2009) to Orthogonal (2025), our mission has remained constant:
      to align consciousness and capital in service of human evolution. We close
      this year strong, integrated, and energized for what comes next.
    </p>

    <p>
      To every investor who believed from the beginning — thank you for your faith,
      your patience, and your commitment to what we are building together.
    </p>

    <p>

      under Orthogonal Thinker, EI Ventures, Psilly, or Reinmkr.
    </p>


    <h2>Closing Thought</h2>

    <p>
      We end 2025 aligned, in process of audit, and vibrating at our highest
      frequency.
    </p>

    <p>
      The foundation is solid, the architecture harmonized, and the future is clear.
      2026 will reveal the true power of coherence — everything together, everything
      Orthogonal.
    </p>

    <p>
      “We’ve been building for two decades to arrive here,” said David Nikzad. “Now
      we move from vision to revelation — where Orthogonal itself becomes the
      signal.”

    Acquisitions, and Enhanced Integration with Lif3 Ecosystem
  summary: ""
  body: >-
    <p>Toronto, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - March 6, 2025) - Cloud3 Ventures
    Inc.&nbsp;(CSE: CLDV) (OTC Pink: CLDVF) (FSE: WQ40) <b>(</b>"<b>Cloud3</b>"
    or the "<b>Company</b>") is thrilled to announce a series of strategic
    initiatives designed to bolster its position within the decentralized
    finance (DeFi) ecosystem and capitalize on emerging opportunities in
    blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI).</p>


    <p><b>New Private Placement Initiative</b></p>


    <p>Building on the momentum of our recent over-subscribed private placement,
    Cloud3 is launching a new non-brokered private placement to raise
    CAD$500,000 at a price of CAD$0.30 per Subordinate Voting Share (SVS). We
    are excited to report that 50% of this round has already been committed,
    reflecting strong investor confidence in our strategic direction. The funds
    raised will be allocated towards expanding our blockchain infrastructure,
    enhancing validator node operations, and acquiring digital assets to
    strengthen our DeFi offerings. </p>


    <p><b>Strategic Asset Acquisitions in Compute and AI</b></p>


    <p>In our ongoing commitment to innovation, Cloud3 is actively pursuing the
    acquisition of assets in the compute and AI sectors. These strategic
    investments aim to enhance our capabilities within the DeFi ecosystem,
    enabling more efficient and secure decentralized applications. By
    integrating advanced AI technologies, we anticipate delivering superior
    services and solutions to our users, further solidifying our leadership in
    the DeFi space.</p>


    <p><b>Integration with Lif3 Ecosystem</b></p>


    <p>All our initiatives are strategically aligned to operate seamlessly
    within the Lif3 ecosystem wallet. This integration ensures that users can
    access a comprehensive suite of DeFi services through a unified platform,
    enhancing user experience and operational efficiency. Our collaboration with
    Lif3 underscores our dedication to providing cutting-edge solutions in the
    decentralized finance landscape.</p>


    <p><b>Expansion of Bitcoin Strategic Reserve</b></p>


    <p>Recognizing the growing importance of Bitcoin in global financial
    markets, Cloud3 plans to augment its Bitcoin holdings as part of our
    strategic reserve. This move aligns with our commitment to maintaining a
    robust and diversified digital asset portfolio, ensuring long-term stability
    and value creation for our stakeholders.</p>


    <p><b>Industry Developments and Global Crypto Adoption</b></p>


    <p>We are closely monitoring recent developments, including President Donald
    Trump's announcement of a U.S. strategic crypto reserve encompassing
    Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. This initiative has sparked
    significant interest and activity within the crypto markets, reflecting a
    broader trend of increasing global crypto adoption. At Cloud3, we are poised
    to leverage these developments, positioning ourselves at the forefront of
    this rapidly evolving industry. </p>


    <p><b>CEO Statement</b></p>


    <p>"Cloud3 Ventures is embarking on an exciting journey of innovation and
    growth," stated David Nikzad, CEO and Co-Founder of Cloud3 Ventures Inc.
    "Our new private placement, strategic asset acquisitions, and deepening
    integration with the Lif3 ecosystem are pivotal steps toward redefining the
    future of decentralized finance. We are committed to delivering exceptional
    value to our shareholders and users by staying ahead of industry trends and
    embracing the transformative potential of blockchain and AI
    technologies."</p>


    <p><b>Regulatory Compliance</b></p>


    <p>The securities issued under the private placement will be subject to a
    hold period under applicable Canadian securities laws expiring four months
    and one day from the closing date of the private placement. The closing of
    the private placement is subject to certain conditions including, but not
    limited to, the submission of all required forms to the Canadian Securities
    Exchange.</p>


    <p>Certain directors of the Company may participate in the Financing. Such
    participation will be considered to be a "related party transaction" as
    defined under Multilateral Instrument 61-101 ("MI 61-101"). The Company
    anticipates relying on exemptions from the minority shareholder approval and
    formal valuation requirements applicable to the related-party transactions
    under sections 5.5(a) and 5.7(1)(a) of MI 61-101, as neither the fair market
    value of the securities to be issued to, nor the consideration to be paid
    by, such persons is anticipated to exceed 25% of the Company's market
    capitalization.</p>


    <p>This announcement does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation
    of an offer to buy any securities in jurisdictions where such actions would
    be unlawful. The securities have not been registered under the United States
    Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be offered or sold in the
    United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from
    registration requirements.</p>

  title: Cloud3 Ventures Inc. Announces Normal Course Issuer Bid and Upsize of
    Private Placement
  summary: ""
  body: >-
    <p>Toronto, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - March 27, 2025) - Cloud3 Ventures
    Inc. (CSE: CLDV) (OTC Pink: CLDVF) (FSE: WQ40) <b>(</b>"<b>Cloud3</b>" or
    the "<b>Company</b>"), announces that it intends to initiate a normal course
    issuer bid ("NCIB") through the facilities of the Canadian Securities
    Exchange or alternative trading systems.</p>


    <p><b>Normal Course Issuer Bid</b></p>


    <p>The Board and management of the Company believe that the Company's shares
    are currently undervalued in the market and that repurchasing shares
    represents a prudent and strategic use of the Company's funds. Accordingly,
    the Company intends to initiate the NCIB to acquire up to 545,461
    Subordinate Voting Shares ("SVS") of the Company, representing approximately
    14.1% of the Company's public float or 5% of the Company's outstanding SVS
    shares as of the date hereof. </p>


    <p>The NCIB is scheduled to commence on April 1, 2025, and end on April 1,
    2026, unless the maximum number of shares is purchased prior to that date or
    the Company elects to terminate the bid earlier. While the Company intends
    to repurchase shares under the NCIB, the timing and extent of such purchases
    will depend on market conditions, regulatory requirements, and other
    factors. There can be no assurance that any shares will be acquired under
    the NCIB.</p>


    <p>The Company has engaged Integral Wealth Securities Limited to administer
    the NCIB and execute share purchases on its behalf. All shares repurchased
    under the NCIB will be returned to treasury and subsequently cancelled. The
    actual number of shares purchased, the timing of such purchases and the
    price paid will be determined based on prevailing market conditions and in
    compliance with applicable securities laws.</p>


    <p><b>Private Placement</b></p>


    <p>The Company is also pleased to announce that it is upsizing its private
    placement announced on March 6, 2025, to CAD$1,000,000 at a price of
    CAD$0.30 per Subordinate Voting Shares (SVS). The Company may offer the
    private placement to residents of the United States who qualify as
    accredited investors pursuant to Rule 506(c) and Regulation D under the
    United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended. </p>


    <p>The Company may engage in general solicitation or advertising in
    connection with this offering, as permitted under Rule 506(c). All
    purchasers in the United States must be accredited investors and must
    satisfy verification requirements. The Company will take reasonable steps to
    verify each U.S. purchaser's accredited investor status through
    documentation such as tax returns, bank statements, third-party verification
    from attorneys or accountants, or other acceptable means under Rule 506(c).
    There is no guarantee that a potential investor will meet the requirements,
    and the Company reserves the right to reject subscriptions that do not
    satisfy applicable verification criteria. The Company will verify accredited
    investor status through third-party verification and/or reasonable steps in
    accordance with Rule 506(c).</p>


    <p>The funds raised will be allocated towards expanding our blockchain
    infrastructure, enhancing validator node operations, and acquiring digital
    assets to strengthen our DeFi offerings.</p>


    <p>The securities issued under the private placement will be subject to a
    hold period under applicable Canadian securities laws expiring four months
    and one day from the closing date of the private placement. In addition, the
    securities issued in the United States will be deemed "restricted
    securities" under Rule 144 and will be subject to limitations on resale
    under applicable U.S. securities laws. The closing of the private placement
    is subject to certain conditions including, but not limited to, the
    submission of all required forms to the Canadian Securities Exchange.</p>


    <p>Certain directors or insiders of the Company may participate in the
    Financing. Such participation will be considered to be a "related party
    transaction" as defined under Multilateral Instrument 61-101 ("MI 61-101").
    The Company anticipates relying on exemptions from the minority shareholder
    approval and formal valuation requirements applicable to the related-party
    transactions under sections 5.5(a) and 5.7(1)(a) of MI 61- 101, as neither
    the fair market value of the securities to be issued to, nor the
    consideration to be paid by, such persons is anticipated to exceed 25% of
    the Company's market capitalization.</p>


    <p>This announcement does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation
    of an offer to buy any securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer,
    solicitation or sale would be unlawful. The securities referenced herein
    have not been registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as
    amended, and are being offered and sold in the United States only to
    accredited investors pursuant to the exemption from registration under Rule
    506(c) of Regulation D. Any offers and sales will be made solely to persons
    who are verified as accredited investors through methods compliant with Rule
    506(c).</p>

  title: "Cloud3 Ventures Inc. Declares Its Mission: A New Era of Conscious
    Technology, Powered by LIF3"
  summary: Canadian Public Company Launches Regenerative Infrastructure Strategy
    Combining Ethical AI, Clean Energy, and Decentralized Healing Tech - with
    50% of Its Financing Round Committed and May Pursue a U.S. Exchange Listing
    in the Future
  body: >-
    <p>Toronto, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - April 22, 2025) - Cloud3 Ventures
    Inc. (CSE: CLDV) (OTCQB: CLDVF) (FSE: WQ40) <b>(</b>"<b>Cloud3 Ventures</b>"
    or the "<b>Company</b>"), a publicly traded company on the Canadian
    Securities Exchange and OTCQB Venture Market, today announced the formal
    activation of its next-generation infrastructure roadmap. Rooted in ethical
    artificial intelligence, clean energy systems, and frequency-based wellness
    technologies - all powered by the LIF3 ecosystem - Cloud3 Ventures is
    pioneering a model for a sovereign, regenerative future.</p>


    <p>More than a tech company, Cloud3 Ventures is an operating movement: one
    committed to rebuilding the digital, energetic, and economic foundations of
    society using systems that prioritize self-sovereignty, emotional
    intelligence, and planetary coherence.</p>


    <p>"Cloud3 Ventures is building the nervous system for a Brave New World,"
    said David Nikzad, Founder and CEO. "With LIF3 as our core engine, we are
    here to build platforms that heal, empower, and decentralize. Energy should
    be free. Technology should serve the soul. Markets should create meaning -
    not just margin. That's what we're doing." </p>


    <p><i>(Mr. Nikzad's statements reflect his philosophical vision. Product
    efficacy and regulatory pathways are subject to ongoing evaluation.)</i></p>


    <p><b>Backed by Orthogonal Thinker</b></p>


    <p>Cloud3 Ventures is proud to have the full, long-term support of
    Orthogonal Thinker, the strategic family office of David Nikzad and Jason
    Hobson. Orthogonal continues to fund major operational expenses,
    intellectual property development, and key infrastructure investments in
    Cloud3.</p>


    <p>"We are 100% behind Cloud3 Ventures, no matter what," said Jason Hobson,
    Managing Partner of Orthogonal Thinker. "This is more than a company - it's
    a mission. We're committed to seeing it through, with capital, energy, and
    shared purpose."</p>


    <p><b>Powered by LIF3</b></p>


    <p>LIF3 is the decentralized, on-chain engine behind Cloud3's stack -
    providing the infrastructure for validator nodes, wellness technology, DeFi
    integration, and decentralized governance. Every Cloud3 product is built on
    LIF3's foundations of sovereignty, healing, and transparency.</p>


    <p><b>Pillars of Development</b></p>


    <p>1. AI with Integrity<br>Cloud3 is deploying decentralized, emotionally
    intelligent AI systems, including validator-powered infrastructure for
    wellness and knowledge platforms.</p>


    <p>2. Free Energy Innovation<br>The Company is developing pilot-scale,
    non-extractive clean energy systems designed for off-grid communities,
    regenerative farms, and sovereign habitats.</p>


    <p>3. Frequency-Based Wellness<br>Cloud3 is bringing forward
    non-pharmaceutical healing tools using vibration, light, and sound - a new
    paradigm of wellness based on resonance, not reaction. </p>


    <p><i>(Statements regarding wellness technologies are based on preliminary
    research or anecdotal evidence and have not been evaluated by the U.S. Food
    and Drug Administration (FDA) or similar regulatory bodies. These
    technologies are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any
    disease. Commercialization may require regulatory approvals not yet
    obtained. Performance claims are illustrative only and actual results may
    vary.)</i></p>


    <p>4. Digital Sovereignty Tools<br>From decentralized ID to regenerative
    finance apps, Cloud3 is building tech that returns control of data,
    economics, and identity to the individual.</p>


    <p><b>Human-Centered Technology for a Fractured World</b></p>


    <p>At the heart of Cloud3 Ventures is a simple belief: loneliness,
    disconnection, and disempowerment are not personal failings - they are
    symptoms of systems designed without the human spirit in mind. We are
    building new systems. Systems that return individuals to wholeness. Systems
    that treat data as sacred, health as frequency, and identity as sovereign.
    In this new architecture, technology doesn't track you - it knows you.
    Energy isn't extracted - it's shared. Healing isn't administered - it's
    remembered. This is our mission: a return to resonance.</p>


    <p><b>Capitalization &amp; Roadmap</b></p>


    <ul><li>50% of Cloud3's current financing round, as announced by the Company
    on March 6, 2025, is committed, with the balance expected to close
    shortly.</li><li>Proceeds are earmarked for infrastructure, validator node
    deployment, and product launches across the wellness and energy
    verticals.</li><li>The Company may explore a potential U.S. exchange listing
    in the future, subject to meeting regulatory, financial and operational
    requirements.</li></ul>


    <p>"The uplisting is not a deadline - it's a destination," said Nikzad.
    "We're committed to getting there responsibly, at the pace that matches our
    growth and our values."</p>

  title: Cloud3 Ventures Inc. Unveils AI and Clean Energy Infrastructure Layer
    Built on LIF3, Powered by Bitcoin and Personal Commitment from Founder David
    Nikzad
  summary: ""
  body: >-
    <p>Toronto, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - April 24, 2025) - Cloud3 Ventures
    Inc. (CSE: CLDV) (OTCQB: CLDV<u>F</u>) (FSE: WQ40) <b>(</b>"<b>Cloud3
    Ventures</b>" or the "<b>Company</b>"), today announced its full commitment
    to developing proprietary AI systems, clean energy infrastructure, and
    blockchain-based tools - all built on the LIF3 ecosystem and supported by
    Founder and CEO David Nikzad, who has personally committed the financial
    resources needed to drive this mission forward.</p>


    <p>Cloud3 is not simply reacting to the times - it's building the core
    infrastructure for a sovereign future. With LIF3 as the technology stack,
    Bitcoin as a foundational asset, and clean energy as the power source,
    Cloud3 is delivering systems that work in harmony with human intelligence,
    planetary health, and long-term freedom.</p>


    <p>"We're creating the blueprint for the next operating system of humanity -
    one rooted in energy freedom, decentralized intelligence, and trustless
    architecture," said David Nikzad, Founder and CEO of Cloud3 Ventures. "This
    is personal. I'm not waiting for permission to build what the world
    needs."</p>


    <p><b>LIF3 as the Foundation</b></p>


    <p>Every layer of Cloud3's architecture - from AI models to physical
    hardware - runs on LIF3, the decentralized ecosystem built for
    composability, scalability, and user sovereignty. It's the unshakable
    digital backbone connecting smart energy systems, intelligent tooling, and
    privacy-first identity frameworks.</p>


    <p><b>Clean Energy That Serves the People</b></p>


    <p>Cloud3's clean energy program focuses on next-generation solar, battery,
    and microgrid systems that remove communities from the grid and give power
    back - literally. The company is developing its own IP in regenerative
    energy systems, engineered to provide low-cost, locally managed, autonomous
    energy networks.</p>


    <p>This isn't about offsetting damage. It's about reversing it.</p>


    <p><b>AI With a Conscience</b></p>


    <p>Cloud3 is building proprietary AI - not outsourced, not extractive. It's
    designed from the ground up to respect data ownership, enhance creative
    work, and guide decision-making in energy, health, and communication
    systems. AI that listens. AI that serves.</p>


    <p><b>Bitcoin as Trust Infrastructure</b></p>


    <p>While LIF3 powers the Cloud3 ecosystem, Bitcoin serves as its store of
    truth and reserve asset. It's the backbone of trust and permanence -
    anchoring everything from data verification to treasury integrity.</p>


    <p>"Bitcoin is energy. It's truth. It's our foundation," Nikzad
    emphasized.</p>


    <p><b>Personally Funded. Vision-Led.</b></p>


    <p>Unlike companies that raise first and figure it out later, Cloud3 is
    already in motion - personally funded and led by Nikzad, whose conviction
    and clarity are fueling rapid development and global team expansion.</p>


    <p>There is no boardroom chasing hype. There is only execution - guided by
    vision, built with soul.</p>


    <p>"I've backed this because it's what I was born to build. We are ready. We
    are focused. And we are doing this for the people who still believe we can
    create something better," said Nikzad.</p>

    securities in any jurisdiction. No securities regulatory authority has

    <p>Toronto, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - May 27, 2025) - Cloud3 Ventures Inc.
    (CSE:&nbsp;CLDV) (OTCQB:&nbsp;CLDVF)
    (FSE:&nbsp;WQ40)&nbsp;<b>(</b>"<b>Cloud3 Ventures</b>" or the

    length non-binding letter of intent with QStarLabs Corporation
    ("<b>QStar</b>") dated May 26, 2025 (the "<b>LOI</b>"), pursuant to which
    Cloud3 will acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of QStar by way
    of a reverse takeover transaction (the "<b>Transaction</b>"). Upon closing,
    shareholders of QStar will own 80% of the issued and outstanding shares of
    the resulting issuer (the "<b>Resulting Issuer</b>"), with 10% held by
    subscribers of the Concurrent Financing (as defined below), and 10% retained
    by existing Cloud3 shareholders. The Resulting Issuer will continue the
    business of QStar as a company listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange
    (the "<b>CSE</b>").</p>


    <p>The Transaction is expected to be completed by way of amalgamation or
    other similar structure, subject to: </p>


    <ul><li>Completion of a minimum C$7,000,000 concurrent financing (the

    <p>It is anticipated that the Definitive Agreement will be executed by July
    31, 2025, and the Transaction is expected to be completed as expeditiously
    as possible. The Company intends to issue a comprehensive news release upon
    execution of the Definitive Agreement disclosing material terms of the
    Transaction. As the Transaction is expected to constitute a "Fundamental
    Change" if completed, pursuant to the policies of the CSE, the Company
    expects that the CSE will impose a trading halt on the Company's shares
    following announcement of the executed Definitive Agreement, which will
    remain in effect until the closing of the Transaction or as otherwise
    determined by the CSE.</p>


    <p>Certain securities issued in connection with the Transaction may be
    subject to escrow or resale restrictions under CSE policies. Pursuant to the
    LOI, the parties have agreed to deal exclusively with each other with regard
    to the Transaction. Upon completion, management and the board of directors
    of the Resulting Issuer will be comprised of nominees of QStar. </p>

  title: Orthogonal Thinker to Acquire Ei.Ventures, Unifying Vision Across
    Consciousness, Wellness, and AI
  summary: ""
  body: >-
    <p>Honolulu, Hawaii--(Newsfile Corp. - August 12, 2025) - Orthogonal
    Thinker, Inc. ("<b>Orthogonal</b>") today announced it has entered into a
    definitive plan to acquire and consolidate Ei.Ventures, Inc. ("EI"), its
    majority-owned subsidiary, into Orthogonal. The transaction, targeted for
    completion by the end of Q1 2026, represents a cornerstone step in
    Orthogonal's multi-year strategy to streamline corporate structure, unify
    investor alignment, and accelerate operational execution across its
    portfolio.</p>


    <p>EI, founded in 2020, was launched to advance health, wellness, and
    consciousness through psychedelic and plant-based science. While the
    company's growth trajectory evolved, its intellectual property, network, and
    early-mover positioning became the foundation for Orthogonal's broader
    ecosystem-now designed to integrate wellness, frequency, and frontier
    technology at scale.</p>


    <p>Upon closing, all minority shareholders of EI will receive equity in
    Orthogonal. The final exchange ratio will be disclosed in formal offer
    documents anticipated in October 2025. Orthogonal confirmed that the
    transaction will include a premium above relative valuation, underscoring
    its commitment to delivering long-term value rather than simply effecting an
    administrative merger.</p>


    <p>"We are not exiting—we're doubling down," said David Nikzad, Founder of
    Orthogonal Thinker. "We're building this like a skyscraper: piece by piece,
    designed to stand for decades. The market is turning, capital is moving
    again, and we're positioned to lead."</p>


    <p>Both Orthogonal and EI hold significant equity positions in Cloud3
    Ventures Inc. (CSE: CVC) (OTCQB: CLVLF), a publicly traded company. While no
    immediate changes are being announced regarding Cloud3, Orthogonal's
    long-term strategy includes consolidating that value under one compliant,
    investor-aligned structure.</p>


    <p>Nikzad added:</p>


    <p>"We are still at the earliest edge of the most profound transformation in
    human history—artificial intelligence. The companies that will endure are
    the ones that build from first principles, adapt in real time, and align
    vision with execution. Orthogonal is that company."</p>


    <p>The transaction is not expected to require a shareholder vote unless
    otherwise mandated by applicable law. Shareholders are advised that no
    action is required until receipt of the formal offer documents.</p>


    <p><b>About Orthogonal Thinker, Inc.</b></p>


    <p>Founded in 2016, Orthogonal deploys capital into visionary founders and
    category-defining companies that improve human health, extend longevity, and
    restore the planet—spanning plant sciences, sustainable energy, advanced
    nutrition, and life-enhancing technologies. Orthogonal operates as an
    integrated holding company, not a passive fund—building an ecosystem where
    each investment strengthens the others. The company's mandate: do good, make
    money doing it, and leave every market better than it was found.</p>

  summary: ""
  body: >-
    <p>Honolulu, Hawai'i--(Newsfile Corp. - September 4, 2025) - Orthogonal
    Thinker, Inc. ("<b>Orthogonal</b>" or the "<b>Company</b>"), a Hawai'i-based
    holding company integrating wellness, plant medicine, artificial
    intelligence, and digital assets, today announced the planned launch of a
    tokenized hedge fund and the continued expansion of its AI-driven LIF3
    ecosystem, alongside significant portfolio milestones across multiple
    industries.</p>


    <p>Founded in 2016, Orthogonal has built a diversified portfolio designed to
    empower individuals through healthy living, frequency-based wellness, and
    regenerative finance. As the Company approaches its 10-year anniversary in
    2026, it continues to execute its strategy of aligning Hawai'i's ethos with
    Wall Street's capital markets by developing compliant, institutional-grade
    structures in emerging sectors.</p>


    <p><b>Portfolio Milestones</b></p>


    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li><p><b>Firefly Aerospace</b> -
    Orthogonal was an original Series A investor in Firefly, which recently
    completed a successful go-public transaction, marking a major liquidity

    investor in BNC's $500 million digital-asset transaction anchored in Binance
    Coin (BNB).</p></li><li><p><b>Odyssey Elixir</b> - The functional beverage

    medicine through ongoing development of nano-compound technologies,
    including the progression of related intellectual property and patent
    applications.</p></li><li><p><b>Cannabis Industry Leadership</b> -
    Orthogonal was an early backer of Meadow, one of the leading cannabis POS
    and compliance platforms in the United States, reflecting the Company's
    long-standing commitment to plant-based innovation and health-conscious

    largest shareholder of Cloud3 Ventures, where it holds its LIF3 token
    position and is actively building validator-node infrastructure to support
    the expansion of the LIF3 ecosystem.</p></li></ul>


    <p><b>Tokenized Hedge Fund</b></p>


    <p>Orthogonal is developing a Hawai'i-based hedge fund that will employ
    tokenization to enhance transparency, efficiency, and investor access. The
    fund's mandate is expected to include validator-node infrastructure,
    structured digital-asset treasuries, and governance-oriented investment
    strategies. The Company is working with leading advisors to ensure the
    fund's structure complies with applicable securities laws and regulatory
    frameworks.</p>


    <p><b>AI Infrastructure &amp; LIF3 Ecosystem</b></p>

    economy. Its AI initiatives are focused on retrieval-augmented intelligence,
    secure data management, and predictive analytics — forming the technological
    backbone of the Company's broader ecosystem.</p>


    <p><b>Bridging Hawai'i and Wall Street Through Innovation</b></p>


    <p>Orthogonal's leadership has spent recent weeks in New York advancing new
    digital asset treasury transactions and working with partners to sponsor
    Tier 1 tokens into the public markets. At the same time, the Company is
    progressing plans for its Innovation Hub and Regenerative Campus in Hawai'i,
    envisioned as a center for plant medicine, technology, and conscious
    community. Together, these efforts highlight Orthogonal's mission to anchor
    its work in Hawai'i's culture of wellness and extend it into the
    institutional capital markets of Wall Street.</p>


    <p><b>Management Commentary</b></p>


    <p>"Our objective has always been to operate with discipline and integrity
    while positioning Orthogonal at the intersection of wellness, technology,
    and capital markets," said David Nikzad, Chief Executive Officer of
    Orthogonal Thinker. "The launch of a tokenized hedge fund and the expansion
    of our AI-driven LIF3 ecosystem are the natural evolution of nearly a decade
    of ecosystem building. With milestones such as Firefly's public listing, our
    investment in BNC's digital-asset transaction, Odyssey Elixir's expansion
    into Costco, continued innovation in psychedelic nano compounds, our early
    role with Meadow in cannabis, and our position as the largest shareholder of
    Cloud3 Ventures — where the LIF3 token and validator-node strategy are being
    advanced — we are proud of the momentum across our portfolio. Spending this
    time in New York, advancing digital asset treasury deals and sponsoring Tier
    1 tokens into the public markets, reflects exactly what we set out to do —
    bring Hawai'i and Wall Street together, with our Innovation Hub in Hawai'i
    as the foundation."</p>

  title: Orthogonal Thinker Launches Capital Infrastructure Group to Power the
    Next Industrial Revolution
  summary: Hawai'i-based holding company launches a platform to design capital
    vehicles, forge strategic alliances, and build infrastructure across AI,
    digital assets, clean energy, DePIN, defense, and longevity
  body: >-
    <p>Honolulu, Hawai'i--(Newsfile Corp. - October 7, 2025) - Orthogonal
    Thinker, Inc. ("<b>Orthogonal</b>" or the "<b>Company</b>"), a Hawai'i-based
    holding company integrating wellness, plant medicine, artificial
    intelligence, and digital assets, today announced the launch of its Capital
    Infrastructure Group, a formal expansion of the Company's role in designing
    capital structures and enabling industrial systems for emerging
    technologies.</p>


    <p>The new group will focus on originating and structuring vehicles,
    alliances, and operating frameworks to direct long-duration capital into
    transformative sectors, including artificial intelligence, digital assets,
    clean energy, validator node infrastructure (physical and digital),
    decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), autonomous defense,
    and human longevity.</p>


    <p>"For nearly a decade, we've built an ecosystem that bridges Hawai'i and
    Wall Street," said David Nikzad, Founder &amp; CEO of Orthogonal Thinker.
    "With the Capital Infrastructure Group in place, we're taking a more active
    role - creating frameworks, alliances, and vehicles - to direct resources
    into the technologies that will define the future."</p>


    <p><b>How Orthogonal Operates</b></p>


    <p>Orthogonal does not act as a broker-dealer or registered investment
    adviser and does not solicit or provide investment advice. The Company
    originates, structures, and partners on transactions and operating
    build-outs - designing capital frameworks that enable scalable industry
    growth. Through public and private structures, tokenized digital-asset
    strategies, validator-node infrastructure, and DePIN models, Orthogonal aims
    to unlock both enterprise performance and the multiplier effects of new
    industrial ecosystems.</p>


    <p>"Markets consistently underestimate the scale and speed of these
    transformations," Nikzad added. "AI, digital assets, clean energy, validator
    networks, DePIN, autonomous defense, and longevity economics are converging
    faster than consensus implies. Our role is to design the legal, structural,
    and strategic pipelines that let capital and innovation flow where they're
    needed most."</p>


    <p><b>Rooted in Wellness, Scaling Globally</b></p>


    <p>Orthogonal remains anchored in its founding ethos of health,
    consciousness, and empowerment. With the Capital Infrastructure Group, the
    Company is scaling those principles into industrial execution - bridging AI,
    digital assets, clean energy, and public markets in a way that honors its
    origins while positioning for global impact.</p>


    <p><b>About Orthogonal Thinker, Inc.​</b></p>

  title: Orthogonal Thinker Announces DAT 3.0 and Planned Integration of
    Ei.Ventures to Unite Capital, Technology, and Purpose
  summary: Hawai'i-Based Holding Company Aligns Capital Infrastructure Group with
    Wellness Foundation to Scale Mission-Driven Public Companies
  body: >-
    <p>Honolulu, Hawai'i--(Newsfile Corp. - October 28, 2025) - <a
    rel="nofollow"
    href="https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/vEqGOumn1o">Orthogonal Thinker,
    Inc.</a> ("<b>Orthogonal</b>" or the "<b>Company</b>"), a Hawai'i-based
    holding company integrating wellness, plant medicine, artificial
    intelligence, and digital assets, today announced DAT 3.0, its
    next-generation Decentralized Autonomous Treasury governance framework, and
    the planned integration of Ei.Ventures under a single operating structure.
    Together with the Company's recently launched Capital Infrastructure Group,
    these initiatives position Orthogonal as both architect and operator of a
    unified ecosystem designed to channel long-term capital into high-impact
    sectors.</p>


    <p>"This is Conscious Capital put to work," said David Nikzad, founder and
    CEO of Orthogonal Thinker. "We're building financial and technological
    systems that expand human potential and create durable value. By bringing
    Ei.Ventures, the Capital Infrastructure Group, and DAT 3.0 together, we're
    laying the foundation for that future."</p>


    <p>Founded in 2020, Ei.Ventures anchors Orthogonal's mission in wellness and
    human performance. Its early plant-science work and intellectual property
    helped shape Orthogonal's Conscious Capital thesis. Consolidating
    Ei.Ventures into Orthogonal brings wellness, technology and finance under
    one roof to drive long-term impact.</p>


    <p>At the center of Orthogonal's platform is DAT 3.0, a rules-based treasury
    governance approach emphasizing transparency, programmability, and
    alignment. Capital Infrastructure Group applies that framework in the market
    - structuring vehicles and alliances that direct capital into AI, digital
    assets, clean energy, DePIN and related sectors. With Ei.Ventures as a
    consciousness-driven foundation, these three components form a living system
    where technology, markets, and human advancement reinforce one another.</p>


    <p>"Decentralized Autonomous Treasuries are where capital and intelligence
    meet," Nikzad added. "We engineered DAT 3.0 to make capital flows auditable,
    adaptive, and mission-aligned. The market is turning and capital is moving
    again - we built Orthogonal for this moment."</p>


    <p><b>About DAT 3.0</b></p>


    <p>DAT 3.0 is Orthogonal's treasury governance framework that combines
    traditional controls with on-chain auditability and programmatic policy. It
    aims to provide transparent reserves and mandates, adaptive allocation
    within predefined guardrails, and long-term alignment between investors,
    operators and the mission.</p>

  body: |-
    <p>Honolulu, Hawai'i--(Newsfile Corp. - October 30, 2025) - <a rel="nofollow" href="https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/xEMYAizN0K">Orthogonal Thinker, Inc.</a> ("<b>Orthogonal</b>" or the "<b>Company</b>"), a Hawai'i-based holding company integrating wellness, plant medicine, artificial intelligence, and digital assets, today announced that its Founder and CEO, David Nikzad, has been appointed Head of Capital Markets for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/7nEpDh01OP">World Mobile Token</a> (WMTx), a blockchain-enabled platform advancing decentralized telecom through a DePIN model.</p>

    <p>In this role, Nikzad will guide capital formation and partnerships that expand World Mobile's decentralized network model, empowering communities worldwide to own a stake in the $2 trillion telecommunications market through token-based participation and community-built mobile networks. </p>

    <p><b>Capital Infrastructure Group Focus</b></p>

    <p>This appointment marks the first initiative announced under Orthogonal's Capital Infrastructure Group, a division that originates and structures Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) and DePIN-based capital frameworks for mission-aligned companies at the intersection of connectivity, energy, and real-world infrastructure.</p>

    <p>"World Mobile's model exemplifies conscious capital - financing infrastructure that expands access while sharing value with the communities that help operate it," said David Nikzad, Founder &amp; CEO of Orthogonal Thinker and Head of Capital Markets at World Mobile Token. "By pairing DePIN economics with telecom, we can scale connectivity and align long-term incentives across operators, users, and capital providers."</p>

    <p><b>Bridging Capital, Connectivity, and Community</b></p>

    <p>World Mobile's ecosystem empowers individuals and entrepreneurs to extend mobile and internet coverage through community-powered AirNodes, driving a fairer, more resilient connectivity model that rewards real-world participation and shared ownership. While local operators earn fiat revenue for delivering service, WMTx underpins the system's rewards for EarthNode Operators and the wider ecosystem.</p>

    <p>"As we expand World Mobile's presence across global markets, capital formation becomes essential to scaling a network that is owned and powered by the people," said Micky Watkins, World Mobile Group Founder and CEO. "David Nikzad brings deep experience bridging traditional finance and blockchain innovation, helping us unlock new ways for communities and investors to participate in the $2 trillion telecom market through our WMTx ecosystem."</p>

    <p>Orthogonal views AI, digital assets, clean energy, and DePIN as foundational vectors for the next phase of industrial and humanitarian progress. The Company's Capital Infrastructure Group partners with teams building decentralized physical infrastructure and the financial rails to support it.</p>

    <p>"Our mandate is to design capital frameworks where innovation and inclusion reinforce each other," Nikzad added. "This partnership bridges capital markets with the world's most essential resource: connection."</p>
