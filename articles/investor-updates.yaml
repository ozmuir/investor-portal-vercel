  title: "Orthogonal – 2030 CEO Letter"
  summary: "Orthogonal moves toward 2030 as a physics-aligned, AI-centric holding platform—driven by David Nikzad’s long-horizon strategy to compound value across energy, compute, connectivity, and human-performance assets at the center of the emerging intelligence economy."
  body: |-
    <p>To our shareholders,</p>
    <p>
      Orthogonal was founded on a simple observation: the global economy is
      undergoing a structural transition unlike any we have experienced in the
      modern era. The foundations of value creation are shifting away from labor,
      human time, and traditional financial capital and toward energy availability,
      computational capacity, network bandwidth, and machine intelligence. These
      inputs are becoming the defining constraints of economic output, innovation,
      and competitiveness.
    </p>
    <p>Our long-term strategy is built around that reality.</p>
    <p>
      By 2030, artificial intelligence and autonomous systems have become central to
      production, logistics, scientific discovery, and decision-making. As these
      systems expand, they place unprecedented demands on physical infrastructure.
      Power consumption rises. Compute density increases. Connectivity requirements
      accelerate. The institutions positioned to benefit in this environment are
      those aligned with the underlying physics, not those dependent on historical
      economic assumptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orthogonal’s mission is to build a holding company that operates coherently
      within this new paradigm. We are focused on acquiring, developing, and
      supporting assets that sit directly on the supply lines of the emerging
      economy: scalable clean energy, high-density compute, distributed
      connectivity, intelligent operating frameworks, and technologies that enhance
      human longevity and cognitive performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      We take a long-duration view. We aim to build structural exposure to the
      elements that become more valuable as AI expands—not less. These include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Energy systems capable of supporting exponential computational demand.
      </li>
      <li>
        Compute-related assets that serve as the industrial engine of an
        intelligence-driven world.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bandwidth and communication infrastructure that function as the circulatory
        layer of the global digital system.
      </li>
      <li>
        AI-native operating models that enhance efficiency, improve decision loops,
        and reduce friction across all business units.
      </li>
      <li>
        Longevity and human-performance technologies that preserve the leadership
        capacity required to operate effectively in a fast-moving,
        machine-accelerated environment.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We believe these categories will form the backbone of the 21st century
      economy. Our focus is not on short-term cycles or narratives, but on durable
      assets that compound through structural demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orthogonal’s approach emphasizes discipline, clarity, and alignment with
      empirical constraints. We favor assets supported by physics — energy, compute,
      and bandwidth — because they are non-negotiable requirements for the systems
      that now drive global productivity. At the same time, we recognize that human
      capability remains essential. Extending the health, cognition, and performance
      of our leadership and teams is not ancillary; it is central to our strategy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our aim is to create a company designed for longevity, compounding, and
      resilience — one capable of operating effectively through rapid technological
      shifts while preserving a clear strategic north star.
    </p>
    <p>
      We appreciate the confidence our shareholders have placed in Orthogonal as we
      continue building a platform aligned with the world ahead, not the world
      behind us. The transition to an intelligence-centric, energy-constrained
      economy is already underway. Our objective is to position Orthogonal at the
      center of that transformation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sincerely,
      <br />
      David Nikzad
      <br />
      Chief Executive Officer
      <br />
      Orthogonal

  title: "2025 Year-End Investor Update"
  summary: "Orthogonal Thinker enters 2026 as a unified, audited, and NASDAQ-bound holding company—integrating EI Ventures, Pluto 11.11, and its global ecosystem into one transparent, frequency-aligned structure bridging consciousness, capital, and exponential innovation."
  body: |-
    <p>Dear Investors and Friends,</p>
    <p>
      As 2025 comes to a close, we extend our deepest gratitude for your trust,
      patience, and partnership.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a transformative year for Orthogonal Thinker, EI Ventures, Reinmkr,
      Pluto 11.11, LIF3, Surya, and Psilly — a year of alignment, integration, and
      clarity as we move from vision to structure and from structure to revelation.
    </p>

    <h2>From Reinmkr to Orthogonal — A 20-Year Journey</h2>
    <p>
      In 2009, David Nikzad and Jason Hobson founded Reinmkr, a private fund built
      on a simple yet radical belief: that capital follows frequency, and that
      alignment between people, purpose, and prosperity creates enduring value.
    </p>
    <p>
      That belief became Orthogonal Thinker Inc. — a global holding company that
      integrates ventures in digital assets, AI, longevity, plant medicine, energy,
      and space.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reinmkr remains the foundation; Orthogonal is its refined expression — a
      living architecture where consciousness and commerce intersect at right
      angles.
    </p>

    <h2>2025 — Execution, Alignment &amp; Preparation</h2>
    <p>
      This year was about building infrastructure that endures and scales with
      integrity.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Cloud3 Audit Completed. Cloud3 Ventures (CSE: CLDV) finalized its
        independent audit, setting the transparency standard for our ecosystem.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ecosystem Integration. We prepared the consolidation of EI Ventures and
        Pluto 11.11 into Orthogonal Thinker Inc., uniting all investors under one
        structure.
      </li>
      <li>
        Orthogonal Audit Roadmap. A comprehensive audit of Orthogonal and its
        subsidiaries will commence in 2026 as part of the consolidation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Global Shareholder Base. Over 11,000 shareholders worldwide; systems
        expanded for governance and communication.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer Agent. Endeavor Trust remains our partner as we modernize investor
        infrastructure for the digital era.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Orthogonal enters 2026 aligned and ready for the next stage of consolidation.
    </p>

    <h2>Strategic Highlights of 2025</h2>
    <h3>Firefly Aerospace — Patience Realized</h3>
    <p>
      Our Series A participation in Firefly Aerospace four years ago came full
      circle with its public listing — a validation of Orthogonal’s long-horizon
      approach to frontier technology.
    </p>
    <h3>BNC — Blockchain Treasury &amp; Financial Innovation</h3>
    <p>
      Our investment in BNC, a BNB-aligned treasury platform, anchored a $500
      million digital-asset transaction and showcased our capacity to engineer
      compliant, institutional-grade blockchain finance.
    </p>
    <h3>STRIVE (ASST) — Bitcoin as the Global Reserve Asset</h3>
    <p>
      Orthogonal took a significant position in STRIVE (ASST), a publicly traded
      vehicle bridging traditional finance and digital assets. We view Bitcoin as
      the new global reserve currency — an energy-anchored, mathematically
      trustworthy foundation for a rebalanced financial system. Through STRIVE, we
      are positioned to help build that system and align our treasury strategy with
      the future of sound money.
    </p>
    <h3>Odyssey Elixir — Functional Wellness Scales</h3>
    <p>
      Portfolio company Odyssey Elixir entered Costco’s national distribution
      network, proving that frequency-based wellness and functional nutrition can
      reach mass adoption.
    </p>
    <h3>Psilly &amp; EI Ventures — Science Meets Spirit</h3>
    <p>
      Psilly, the origin of EI Ventures, continues advancing plant-medicine and
      emotional-wellness technologies that merge ancient therapies and modern
      science.
    </p>
    <h3>Capital Markets Leadership — World Mobile &amp; Blockstreet</h3>
    <p>
      David Nikzad serves as Head of Capital Markets for World Mobile Group and
      Blockstreet.
    </p>
    <p>
      At World Mobile, he helps scale a decentralized telecom network connecting the
      unconnected; at Blockstreet, a launchpad platform, he leverages his experience
      from WeFunder and Republic to merge crowdfunding innovation with institutional
      discipline.
    </p>
    <h3>Reinmkr — The Philosophical Core</h3>
    <p>
      Reinmkr remains our energetic center — the belief that capital is an extension
      of consciousness and that investing in frequency is investing in the future.
    </p>

    <h2>Governance &amp; Structural Milestones</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Cloud3 Ventures Audit. Completed in 2025, establishing transparent reporting
        and setting the standard for our ecosystem.
      </li>
      <li>
        Orthogonal Ecosystem Audit. Full audit to begin in 2026 as part of the
        consolidation process.
      </li>
      <li>
        Digital Asset Treasury (DAT 3.0). Our treasury architecture now unifies
        on-chain transparency with traditional accounting — a blueprint for the
        public-market era of Conscious Capital.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Strategic Integration and Expansion</h2>
    <h3>EI Ventures &amp; Pluto Integration — January 2026</h3>
    <p>
      We are finalizing the consolidation of EI Ventures and Pluto 11.11 into
      Orthogonal Thinker Inc. This transaction will be completed in January 2026,
      uniting all shareholders, brands, and intellectual property under one cap
      table and one vision.
    </p>
    <h3>Capital Infrastructure Group (CIG)</h3>
    <p>
      The Capital Infrastructure Group designs and originates specialized
      transactions in AI, energy, and digital assets — connecting institutional
      capital with frontier innovation through compliant, mission-driven
      architecture.
    </p>
    <h3>Insomnia Labs Partnership — DAT 3.0 on NASDAQ</h3>
    <p>
      Our four-year partnership with Insomnia Labs is the defining collaboration for
      our next chapter. Together we are creating the DAT 3.0 NASDAQ framework, which
      will serve as the foundation for a unified, publicly traded Orthogonal Thinker
      Inc. vehicle.
    </p>
    <p>
      This structure merges Insomnia’s technical and creative expertise with our
      capital architecture to build a transparent, programmable public company that
      embodies Conscious Capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the core of our 2026 vision: a single NASDAQ-listed structure that
      brings the entire Orthogonal ecosystem together under one standard of
      alignment and frequency.
    </p>

    <h2>Operational Initiatives — Cap Table &amp; Investor Portal</h2>
    <p>
      We know many investors are curious about how we’ll manage our transfer agent
      and shareholder records. We continue working closely with Endeavor Trust to
      determine the most effective way to digitize our entire cap table.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s not a simple process — it requires precision, compliance, and technical
      innovation. Over the next two months, we’ll be doubling down on our Investor
      Portal, which will become the primary interface for all shareholders in the
      Orthogonal ecosystem.
    </p>
    <p>
      After pausing development to complete the Cloud3 audit, we have resumed full
      focus on this project. Cap-table digitization and portal completion are key
      pillars of the 2026 roadmap, and we deeply appreciate everyone’s patience as
      we deliver this modernization.
    </p>

    <h2>Portfolio Impact</h2>
    <p>
      Our companies delivered strong performance and real-world validation of our
      mission:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Firefly Aerospace — successful IPO and liquidity event.</li>
      <li>BNC — major digital-asset treasury transaction.</li>
      <li>STRIVE (ASST) — strategic Bitcoin exposure and macro alignment.</li>
      <li>Odyssey Elixir — national retail expansion.</li>
      <li>Meadow — continued leadership in cannabis compliance software.</li>
      <li>
        Cloud3 &amp; LIF3 — advances in validator-node and AI-integrated DeFi
        infrastructure.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Beyond these milestones, the Orthogonal ecosystem encompasses a broad network
      of investments and collaborations across wellness, fintech, blockchain, and
      space — from early-stage equity in EquipmentShare, WeFunder, Republic, and
      Betterment, to strategic positions in Animoca Brands, Unstoppable Domains,
      Supra Oracles, Polygon, Dynasty Studios, Compass Mining, Near Protocol,
      Insomnia Labs, and Axiom Space.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our reach extends across AI, DeFi, wellness technology (NovoBeing), plant
      science, and frontier infrastructure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each company reinforces the next, forming a living ecosystem of innovation
      guided by Orthogonal’s principles of consciousness, alignment, and exponential
      value creation.
    </p>

    <h2>Looking Ahead to 2026 — Unification Through Orthogonal</h2>
    <p>
      2026 marks Orthogonal Thinker’s 10-Year Anniversary and the culmination of a
      two-decade vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the year we bring everything to the top of the funnel — Orthogonal
      Thinker Inc. All ventures, brands, and partnerships will unite in a NASDAQ
      vehicle built on the DAT 3.0 standard in collaboration with Insomnia Labs.
    </p>
    <p>Our focus for the year ahead:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Finalize the EI Ventures and Pluto integration in January 2026.</li>
      <li>
        Launch the Insomnia Labs DAT 3.0 NASDAQ framework to unify the ecosystem.
      </li>
      <li>
        Integrate our STRIVE (ASST) Bitcoin initiative into treasury strategy.
      </li>
      <li>Complete the Investor Portal and cap-table digitization program.</li>
      <li>
        Begin construction of the Orthogonal Innovation Hub in Hawai‘i, a
        regenerative campus where AI, wellness, and energy systems merge.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      2026 is the year of unification and ascension — when Orthogonal Thinker Inc.
      becomes a living public structure embodying the alignment of frequency,
      finance, and human potential.
    </p>

    <h2>Perspective &amp; Gratitude</h2>
    <p>
      From Reinmkr (2009) to Orthogonal (2025), our mission has remained constant:
      to align consciousness and capital in service of human evolution. We close
      this year strong, integrated, and energized for what comes next.
    </p>
    <p>
      To every investor who believed from the beginning — thank you for your faith,
      your patience, and your commitment to what we are building together.
    </p>
    <p>

      under Orthogonal Thinker, EI Ventures, Psilly, or Reinmkr.
    </p>

    <h2>Closing Thought</h2>
    <p>
      We end 2025 aligned, in process of audit, and vibrating at our highest
      frequency.
    </p>
    <p>
      The foundation is solid, the architecture harmonized, and the future is clear.
      2026 will reveal the true power of coherence — everything together, everything
      Orthogonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We’ve been building for two decades to arrive here,” said David Nikzad. “Now
      we move from vision to revelation — where Orthogonal itself becomes the
      signal.”
