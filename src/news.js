    body: `<p>Honolulu, Hawai'i--(Newsfile Corp. - September 4, 2025) - Orthogonal Thinker, Inc. ("<b>Orthogonal</b>" or the "<b>Company</b>"), a Hawai'i-based holding company integrating wellness, plant medicine, artificial intelligence, and digital assets, today announced the planned launch of a tokenized hedge fund and the continued expansion of its AI-driven LIF3 ecosystem, alongside significant portfolio milestones across multiple industries.</p><p>Founded in 2016, Orthogonal has built a diversified portfolio designed to empower individuals through healthy living, frequency-based wellness, and regenerative finance. As the Company approaches its 10-year anniversary in 2026, it continues to execute its strategy of aligning Hawai'i's ethos with Wall Street's capital markets by developing compliant, institutional-grade structures in emerging sectors.</p><p><b>Portfolio Milestones</b></p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li><p><b>Firefly Aerospace</b> - Orthogonal was an original Series A investor in Firefly, which recently completed a successful go-public transaction, marking a major liquidity event for the Company's early-stage venture portfolio.</p></li><li><p><b>BNC Digital Asset Deal</b> (BNB Treasury) - Orthogonal participated as an investor in BNC's $500 million digital-asset transaction anchored in Binance Coin (BNB).</p></li><li><p><b>Odyssey Elixir</b> - The functional beverage brand has entered Costco, expanding national distribution and strengthening its position in the wellness consumer market.</p></li><li><p><b>Psychedelic Nano Compounds</b> - Orthogonal continues to advance its work in psychedelic medicine through ongoing development of nano-compound technologies, including the progression of related intellectual property and patent applications.</p></li><li><p><b>Cannabis Industry Leadership</b> - Orthogonal was an early backer of Meadow, one of the leading cannabis POS and compliance platforms in the United States, reflecting the Company's long-standing commitment to plant-based innovation and health-conscious consumer products.</p></li><li><p><b>Cloud3 Ventures</b> - Orthogonal is the largest shareholder of Cloud3 Ventures, where it holds its LIF3 token position and is actively building validator-node infrastructure to support the expansion of the LIF3 ecosystem.</p></li></ul><p><b>Tokenized Hedge Fund</b></p><p>Orthogonal is developing a Hawai'i-based hedge fund that will employ tokenization to enhance transparency, efficiency, and investor access.

The Company is working with leading advisors to ensure the fund's structure complies with applicable securities laws and regulatory frameworks.</p><p><b>AI Infrastructure &amp; LIF3 Ecosystem</b></p><p>The Company continues to expand the LIF3 ecosystem, integrating AI-driven data infrastructure with digital-asset strategies to deliver personalized health and adaptive financial tools.

Together, these efforts highlight Orthogonal's mission to anchor its work in Hawai'i's culture of wellness and extend it into the institutional capital markets of Wall Street.</p><p><b>Management Commentary</b></p><p>"Our objective has always been to operate with discipline and integrity while positioning Orthogonal at the intersection of wellness, technology, and capital markets," said David Nikzad, Chief Executive Officer of Orthogonal Thinker. "The launch of a tokenized hedge fund and the expansion of our AI-driven LIF3 ecosystem are the natural evolution of nearly a decade of ecosystem building. With milestones such as Firefly's public listing, our investment in BNC's digital-asset transaction, Odyssey Elixir's expansion into Costco, continued innovation in psychedelic nano compounds, our early role with Meadow in cannabis, and our position as the largest shareholder of Cloud3 Ventures — where the LIF3 token and validator-node strategy are being advanced — we are proud of the momentum across our portfolio. Spending this time in New York, advancing digital asset treasury deals and sponsoring Tier 1 tokens into the public markets, reflects exactly what we set out to do — bring Hawai'i and Wall Street together, with our Innovation Hub in Hawai'i as the foundation."</p><p><b>About Orthogonal Thinker, Inc.</b></p><p>Orthogonal Thinker is a Hawai'i-based holding company founded in 2016.
